I am your average student who spends too much time with his computer: An opt-out when it comes to doing homework or preparing anything for school, instead wasting hours hacking on problems I didn't even realize I had. Subtle hints by my girlfriend and family, they'd rather see me more often don't go unnoticed.

When I'm not hacking on my latest pet project
[Volafile.io](http://volafile.io), I may be working on some other shiny project or wasting time on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).

Whatever it is, likely there's at least some overlap with your interests,
wouldn't you be elsewhere otherwise?
