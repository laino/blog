*What to say in a first post?*

I am your average student who spends too much time with his computer: An opt-out 
when it comes to doing homework or preparing anything for school, instead wasting
hours hacking on problems I didn't even I know I had. Subtle hints by my
girlfriend and family, they'd rather see me more often don't go unnoticed.

When I'm not hacking on my latest pet project
[Volafile.io](http://volafile.io), I may be improving my Android WLan sniffer
and spoofer (which I plan to Open Source, I promise!) or wasting time on 
[Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).

Whatever it is, likely there's at least some overlap with your interests,
wouldn't you be elsewhere otherwise?
