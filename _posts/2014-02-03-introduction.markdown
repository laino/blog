I am your average student who spends too much time with his computer: I prefer wasting my time hacking on problems I didn't even realize I had over doing most other things. But subtle hints by my girlfriend and family, they'd rather see me more often don't go unnoticed.

When I'm not hacking on my latest pet project
[Volafile.io](http://volafile.io), I may be working on some other shiny project or wasting time on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).

Whatever it is, likely there's at least some overlap with your interests. If not I'd have to ask how you even ended up here.
